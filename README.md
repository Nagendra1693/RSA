# RSA
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret (private). In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers, the "factoring problem".

RSA in implemented in this application.

Prerequisites : 
  JAVA SDK

    Turn on the "Allow less secure apps" present in the bottom of the page

Steps :
1. Run the KeysGenerator.java 
2. Required values will be generated
3. Copy the values into Application.java and DecryptionApplication.java files
